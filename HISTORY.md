- Used **Pydantic v2** for request/response models

### üß™ Testing
- Integrated **pytest**
- Wrote unit tests for:
  - Health check endpoint
  - Item creation and retrieval
- MongoDB mocked for local tests
- Tests run successfully both locally and in CI

### üßπ Code Quality
- Configured **ruff** for linting
- Enabled **auto-fix** with `ruff --fix`
- Added linting to GitHub Actions (CI fails on lint errors)

### ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps & Tooling
- Added `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment
- Created `docker-compose.yml` with:
  - FastAPI app
  - MongoDB service
- Environment managed via `.env` and `python-dotenv`
- Set up Python virtual environment `.venv`

### üîÑ CI/CD
- Added **GitHub Actions workflow** with:
  - Service container for MongoDB
  - Test job using `pytest`
  - Lint job using `ruff`
  - MongoDB health check before running tests

## Next Steps (planned)
- Add **Trivy** to scan Docker images
- Possibly integrate **type checking** (`mypy` or `pyright`)
- Prepare for deployment (Azure, AWS, or other)
- Write full `README.md`
